=============
Folder Name: src    (This folder has all the source code files)
             Files: rip.c: Source file RIP.
					node.config: Virtual IP to physical IP and port mapping file.		
					neighbor.config: Details regarding the node topology, where it will show the connetivity details with the cost associated.
                    unp.h: Header file
					rip.o: Object file of source file
					All the above files are placed in src/unpv13e/proxy


Folder Name: doc    (This folder contains all the documentation)
             Files: README: This file which you are reading.
                    design_doc: Document describes the design for this project.
                    App_layer_spec: Describes the details of protocol.


File: Makefile:     Is a configuration file which will use the make utility to build the software from its source file.


What works:
==========
1. Node is able to get the details from the neighbour.config file and node.config file.
2. Make connection to the neighbors and it can send and receive from the neighbours. 
3. Have implemented 30 seconds timer to send and 180 seconds timeout to check if there is timeout for data receiving.
4. Using teh belman Ford alogorith, it can calculate the least cost path in few interval of time after few iterations as expected.
5. It will be able to find the least cost and it will be in stable state.
6. Updating node to infinity when the node does not responds after 180 seconds of timeout which was not working in the first submission is fixed now.

What doesn't work:
====================
1. During first couple of minutes when recvfrom is executed observing received IP (client IP) as "255.127.0.0" so, need to bring down the node for testing after around 3 minutes.
